Personalizes marketing powered by AR in locations such as subway stations and airports, etc. DFS would rent these marketing spaces to merchants. Based on previous purchase history, people walking by would be served a personalized advertisement to them with the option for quick purchase.

Current traditional advertisement system does have a lot of problems. Though most billboards may be viewed thousand times in a day by many people, most of us would ignore it or not interested. For customers, most ads do not match our need. That\'s the key problem.

The second problem is that most billboards could only show one or few ads most of the time, which causes the cost to be very high because its efficiency and flexibility is so bad. Many merchants have to spend a huge amount of money on ads but the conversion rate is so low.

The third problem is the timeliness. When a customer finally see an advertisement that he/she is interested in, he/she can not purchase it immediately. Instead, we need to wait after going back home and the order on a computer or use a mobile phone, which again, is very inefficient.

Now, we provide one simple solution, the game changer, Your Ads system. AR is a perfect solution to this problem. Based on your personal preference or history, Your Ads system will give you the personal ads on billboards. ​

​For the customer, we get what we want. We do not need to tolerate any boring ads, instead, we always see ads that we are really interested in. And the customer does not need to wait anymore. By using Hololens or mobile phone, the customer could finish ordering instantly because all the transactions and payment will be handled by Your ads system.

For merchants, the cost will lower down greatly because by using the Your ads system, one billboard could load thousands of ads and the conversion rate will be much higher.

We did some simple estimation for the overall revenue. There will be three major parts: Charges to Merchant, Interchange fees, and newly opened accounts. Take the Boston Logan Airport for example, the revenue will be around $235000.

By using the AR technology, we could make the ads become interactive with the customer. Instead of 2D photos or videos, the customer could actually see the 3D live model and could drag or see the product from any angle. The whole system could be controlled by voice and hand gesture.

By using the machine learning technology, the Your Ads system could find your preference and presents what you like.

The digital payment process will use the modern mature technology to make sure the transaction is secure and fast.
